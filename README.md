## Virtual Patient Chatbot for Pharmacist Training

### Project Description:
In this project, we need to create a chatbot that acts as a patient to train and improve
pharmacy studentsâ€™ skills by seeking consultation from them. The chatbot will give
feedback at the end of the session which shows the overall performance of the
student. We are using DialogFlow API for this project since it has extensive language
processing capabilities and can produce the appropriate outputs needed to generate
the feedback. In addition, a database is also required which helps to record user
inputs as well as for login authentication. Further improvements and understandings
are required in order to improve our chatbot functionality.
